**Incrementality analysis toolkit**

Diane Dou 2022-11-07

This folder contains causal inference methods used for analyzing incrementality of Instacart initiatives. 

**Main objective of the analyses**

Often times, we resort to observational studies when A/B test is not applicatble or not sufficient in measuring initiatives' impact. The automated analysis aims to estimate (heterogeneous) treatment effects with categorical treatments and implemented forest-based method to address high-dimensional data with non-parametric solutions.

**Models included in the tookkit**

- Doubly robust eatimation 
  - Causal forest (General random forest, grf)

- Inverse propensity score estimation 
  - XGBoost Classifier 


**Main model output**

- DR estimator for average (heterogeneous) treatment effect
- Inverse propensity score re-weighting estimator for average treatment effect 
  - Inverse propensity score 
  - Synthetic control groups (control groups matched with exposed users using the propensity score)
